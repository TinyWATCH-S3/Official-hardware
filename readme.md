# TinyWATCH-S3 Official Hardware

In this repository, you will find all of the KiCAD design files for the official Unexpected Maker TinyWATCH-S3

**The current release version of the TinyWATCH S3 hardware is revision P4.**

Please note that the license for these design files is the CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2, which requires any use of these design files to be also kept fully open source under the same license.

So though you are free to use these files in your own projects, and even commercialise them, the "thing" you make must be open source and shared with the community.

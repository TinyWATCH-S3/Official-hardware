# TinyWATCH-S3 revision P4

I've made my best efforts to ensure consistency between the PCB layout and Schematic in terms of component values and packages.

Many footprints in the design reference non-standard (library) footprints, and I don't offer a library for them as they are already embedded in PCB layout anyway. 

If you do find any other inconsistencies, please create a PR, or raise an issue, thanks :)
